2. (Optional) Write a program that asks the user to think of a number between 1 and 10.
The program then tries to guess the number and asks the user if the computerâ€™s guess
is right. If the guess is not right, ask the user if the guess is high or low and then take
another guess. When the guess is correct, report how many guesses it took to get the
right number.
